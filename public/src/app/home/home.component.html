                    LMS stands short for Learning Management System.
                    Learning, because you use it to deliver education courses or training programs.              
                    Management, because it helps you organize these courses (create them, change them, assign them to students, grade them, etc).
                    System, last but not least, is just a fancy word that translates to "software". An LMS is a computer program.
                    Just like Word helps you write documents and Gmail helps you manage your emails, an LMS is a software program that helps you create, manage and deliver eLearning courses.
                    An LMS is the "engine" that powers eLearning, and in the most common form it consists of two separate parts:
                    - A server component that performs the core functionality (creating, managing and delivering courses, authenticating users, serving data and notifications, etc.)
                    - A user interface that runs inside your browser as a web (like Gmail or Facebook), that is used by administrators, instructors and students

                An LMS can be used for all kinds of learning activities (that's why they put the "L" in the acronym after all). But it's also an invaluable business tool, one that has been embraced by enterprises and organizations big and small.
                Here are some of the most common use cases for an LMS platform:
                Employee training
                The need to train new employees or teach existing employees new skills is a constant, whether you are an insurance company, a scooter factory, a hospital or a government organization.
                With an LMS you can cut down on costs and eliminate business disruptions associated with traditional learning, by letting your employees study the material online and at their own pace.
                With eLearning, businesses not only spend less money and effort compared to bringing in specialized instructors to give conventional seminars, but also gain better insights on their employees' progress with integrated monitoring and reporting tools.
                Employee orientation
                The all-important task of onboarding a new hire can be automated and handled easily by an LMS.
                You still get to greet them and give them a tour around the office, but all the rest they can study at their own pace (and refer back to it, whenever they need).
                An onboarding course can include all the stuff nobody pays much attention to (the message from the CEO, the company's history, etc.), as well as the all-important detailing of their role and responsibilities, information about career advancement opportunities and benefits.
                It's also a good place to educate your new hires of your company's employee conduct code, privacy guidelines, and race/sexual harassment policies.
                Knowledge retention
                Training your employees is one thing, but learning from them is also important. A knowledge retention program ensures that valuable skills, techniques and information stays with your company when your employees leave or retire.
                It's also a good fit for an LMS platform, as you don't want this valuable information to just sit in some document management system that nobody ever checks, but to have it available at all times to train new employees or people coming from other departments.
                Education
                Last, but not least, an LMS is a good fit for general educational offerings (duh!).
                It could be a school selling online lessons, a traditional educational institution supplementing its classroom based courses, a business educating its clients, or even a government agency or NGO helping educate the general population.
                In all these forms, and many more, eLearning is here to stay, to the degree that it might be the very future of learning.

                    In order to deliver your eLearning content you first need to add it in your LMS.
                    You can do this by either creating your course material from scratch (by writing your lessons' content inside the LMS), or by importing existing material (a Word document, a PowerPoint presentation, Wikipedia articles, etc.).
                    Advanced LMS platforms, such as TalentLMS, let you add course material from various sources and in different formats, and even allow you to incorporate multimedia files (video, audio, graphics, etc.) to your lessons.
                    Another essential feature related to course creation is the easy inclusion of online assets (from YouTube videos and Wikipedia articles to online presentations and tweets), which lets you leverage the wealth of material available online.
